* Settings on Microsoft Windows

** Keyboard
*** SharpKeys
Load the RegularMap.skl in SharpKeys.
The Keyboard is mapped like this:

- L_Alt  -> L_Ctrl
- L_Win  -> L_Alt
- L_Ctrl -> L_Win
- R_Alt  -> R_Ctrl
- R_Win  -> R_Alt

*** AutoHotkey
- windowsconf.ahk

The original personal config, which uses Ctrl-1, Ctrl-2 to switch workspaces around,

and Win-[ to diminish window title bar.

- windows-desktop-switcher

Third party project. Use desktop_switcher.ahk script to switch workspace.

Got some behaviors as in Linux i3wm/sway style, i.e. Ctrl-[1-5] to choose exactly the workspace. 

Custom instructions added to use Win-[ and Win-] to diminish and resume window title bar.
